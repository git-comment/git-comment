# Contribution Guide

## Development Dependencies

Development dependencies are listed in the `INSTALL` file and include [Go](http://golang.org), [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com), [make](https://www.gnu.com/software/make), and various libraries available via `go get`. The command `make bootstrap` installs the library dependencies.

The manual is written using [pod2man](http://perldoc.perl.org/pod2man.html), which should be available on most GNU/Linux and OS X distributions by default. Changes should be documented with friendliness in mind.
